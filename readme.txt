Track Outbound Link Clicks Easily: Shorten & track your site links by using your own domain name. e.g. "your-domain.com/go/link"

== Description ==

Through Linker's short url tool you can know on which links your visitors are clicking. Linker is the easiest tool to use in order to create a short link in your own domain & track outbound link clicks from your website, using software like Google Analytics.
Create short links to your post, manage your 301 redirects, track affiliate links and do many other URL related tasks easily.

<h4>Major Features</h4>
* Create Short and clean URLs, using your own domain.
* Redirect links to any location, both inbound and outbound, using 301 redirects.
* Track outbound link clicks, with internal reporting for Hits per link.
* Enjoy an intuitive and User Friendly Admin Interface
* Setup tracking easily using Linker's out of the box functionality.

<h4>How it Works?</h4>
Linker adds a new custom post type to your Admin menu, where you can create, edit, delete, and manage Links by 301 redirects. What's great about Linker is that it tracks click counts and saves them as a custom field. it's really simple & cool and there is no setup involved. It works seamlessly straight out of the box for whichever theme and plugins you are using.

<strong>Link Example</strong>: Just to make it extra clear, here's how the Linker plugin works.

* Original URL: https://wordpress.org/plugins/linker/
* New URL with Linker: https://pojo.me/go/linker/

<h4>Integration with Google Analytics by Yoast</h4>
Linker works well with [Google Analytics for WordPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/) by Yoast.

In order to setup tracking for Google Analytics by Yoast, you need to first go to the Setting page.

1. General Tab > "Track outbound click and downloads" Checkbox > check it
1. Advanced Tab > "Set path for internal links to track as outbound links" Field > enter `/go/`
1. Advanced Tab > "Label for those links" Field > Choose which Label to use (Not required).

Now all of your website outbound clicks will show up automatically in Google Analytics. To view them, go to your account in Google Analytics.
<br />
Under: Content > Event Tracking > Categories, youâ€™ll see the Label that you used for each link. That's all there is to it!
